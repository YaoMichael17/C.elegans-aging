## How we have addressed prior feedback 

We have moved test.py and Changes in stress gene expression during C. elegans aging.R from the data directory into the src directory. Based on peer review feedback, we are incorporating the housekeeping genes ama1, act1, and cdc42 as reference points for our stress hallmark genes. We also added additional stress-related hallmark genes including gpx-7, sip1, and myo5. The mouse dataset contains multiple tissue and cell specificity, and we are currently working on coding tissue specific stress hallmark genes in C. elegans.

## New progression

In regards to the python script, we are currently trying to categorize the stress genes to specific tissues. The original paper provides supplemental data with PCA clusters related to tissues. We are currently working on trying to extract this information from the .h5ad file but have run into issues.

Using RStudio, we generated a heatmap that clusters our stress genes into different groups using the k-means method we learned in Week 7. We first grouped gene expression by gene and timepoint to examine expression at each stage. Then we converted the data into wide format and calculated the standard deviation across timepoints for each gene. Finally, we produced a heatmap showing how gene expression changes over time, with genes of similar expression patterns clustered together.

## Project Organization

We have moved test.py and Changes in stress gene expression during C. elegans aging.R from the data directory into the src directory. We have also updated the RStudio script with our new code for generating the heatmap plot using k-means clustering.

## Struggles we are encountering and questions we would like advice on 

Currently, we are having difficulty grouping the stress genes by specific tissues in Python for the C. elegans dataset, which is necessary for comparing them to the tissue types present in the mouse dataset. We are working on extracting this information from the .h5ad file but have encountered several issues. Additionally, when trying to add new stress hallmark genes for improved k-means clustering and housekeeping genes for relative comparison, we ran into a problem in our code where the generated CSV file no longer includes the timepoint column. We are currently troubleshooting both problems.
